Please run the codebooks in the following order:

1. K_Garcia_Part1-3_JupyterNotebook.ipynb
  This Jupyter notebook contains the code for requesting json from an API, data cleaning and graphs.
  final_dataset.csv is my data file that I used to import into R. 

2. K_Garcia_Part4_RNotebook.Rmd
This R notebook contains the code for the regressions, as well as discussions of the results.

Technical Note: The files taxi_zone_lookup.csv and 2022_Yellow_Taxi_Trip_Data_20240330.csv (too large for github) are the csv files I used in python to build my final dataset.
  I shared the 2022 yellow taxi data via google drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J5MHEcRSTJHPCkqQ06O_arWIBzazTSBZ/view?usp=sharing

Thank you!
